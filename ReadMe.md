Sudoku solver project with backtracking. Did not follow a tutorial for this project.


Todo list:

_ Handle long runtimes

_ More efficient algorithm (fixes previous step?)

_ Fix visualization freezing (threading?)

_ Keep pre-entered digits on screen after resetting

- Option to load sudoku from file
