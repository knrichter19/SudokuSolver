Sudoku solver project with backtracking. Did not follow a tutorial for this project.

Todo list:

X Working solver algorithm

X GUI sudoku input

X GUI algorithm visualization

_ Handle long runtime for unsolvable puzzles

_ More efficient algorithm (handles previous step?)

_ Toggle visualization of algorithm
