Sudoku solver project with backtracking. Did not follow a tutorial for this project.

Todo list:

X Working solver algorithm

X GUI sudoku input

X GUI algorithm visualization

X Catch unsolvable puzzles? (some at least)

X Reorganize buttons

_ Handle long runtimes

_ More efficient algorithm (fixes previous step?)

X Toggle visualization of algorithm

_ Fix visualization freezing (threading?)
